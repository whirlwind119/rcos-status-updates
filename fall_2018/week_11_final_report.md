## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

I made different enemies for the game.

## Future Plans

RPI-KArt has a lot of potential growth. Our group loved the idea of having the game be cyberpunk. Unfortunately, none of us are artists, so we had no clue how to make good cyberpunk art. Furthermore, making a level editor would have been a great asset to our kind of game.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing

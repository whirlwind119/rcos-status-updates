## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

I came up with different enemies to act different. For example, a sniper enemy will shoot a lot slower than his machine-gun counter part, but will deal significantly more damage.

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

I will implement these enemies into the game and balance them to make them neither broken nor too weak.

## Anything Blocking?

Final projects in a couple projects

## Notes

> This is an optional section for any sort of information that does not fall under any of the other categories.
